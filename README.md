# Stock Market Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze stock market data using Python, focusing on fetching data, processing it to derive key metrics, visualizing trends, and implementing an alert mechanism for significant market events.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Utilizes the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data including daily prices (open, close, high, low) and trading volume for specified ticker symbols.
  
- **Data Processing:** Employs `pandas` and `numpy` for data cleaning, transformation, and calculation of:
  - Moving Averages (20-day, 50-day)
  - Bollinger Bands (upper and lower)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Daily Returns and Cumulative Returns
  
- **Visualization:** Utilizes `matplotlib` to create visualizations such as:
  - Time series plots
  - Moving average overlays
  - Bollinger Bands plots
  - RSI charts
  - MACD analysis graphs
